// ------ NOTES on prototypes --------
// there are no classes in JS
// every single object is built by a constructor function
// JS and Lua are the only lang you can create an object wo a class
// Java other lang should be called class oriented
// the beauty of prototype linkage we can delegate to different object of method call
// only one cope of function, two objects can use the same object
// this keyword is really nice in the prototype model

// Contructor -- Function that has the new keyword
// [[Prototype]] -- linkage from one object to another object
// It delegates up the prototype chain


// ------ Behavior Delegation --------
// OLOO Objects Linked to Other Objects
